# Background  
- Government of India has opened for covid vaccination to all eligible indians [18+]
- Securing vaccination is 2 step process  
   - Step-1: Registering on cowin portal and securing a registration number [This can be completed without any surprise].
   - Step-2: Securing an available slot for vaccination [cowin-prompter improves supplies inputs to this step].
#
#
# Problem Description   
- Securing vaccination slot may take a little while because of quickly vanishing slots  
   - NOTE: While you reading this page, enormous efforts are made to ramp up slots availability. But current situation would persist for sometime
- Currently there are 2 options available to acertain slot availability,  
   - Option-1: cowin portal  
      - Need to manually keep refereshing
      - Takes time to alter choices, incase of multiple selection criteria [more than one pincode, district]
   - Option-2: Third party alert (app/sms/mail)
      - Additional & unavoidable hops inserted during routing of slots availability, i.e., delayed delivery
      - By the time you generate OTP to book slot, they are gone :(
